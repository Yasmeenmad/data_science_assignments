Your assignment is to build a function to tell the instructor how many people need to be in the room to give him/her a better than 50% chance of winning the `$20`. That is to say, how many people need to be in a room in order for the probability of two of them having the same birthday is greater than 50%. Do the same for 95% and 99%."
