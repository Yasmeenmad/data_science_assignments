    "The World Happiness Report is a publication of the Sustainable Development Solutions Network, powered by data from the Gallup World Poll and Lloyd’s Register Foundation, who provided access to the World Risk Poll. The 2021 Report includes data from the ICL-YouGov Behaviour Tracker as part of the COVID Data Hub from the Institute of Global Health Innovation.\n",

    "The Report is supported by The Ernesto Illy Foundation, illycaffè, Davines Group, The Blue Chip Foundation, The William, Jeff, and Jennifer Gross Family Foundation, The Happier Way Foundation, Indeed, and Unilever’s largest ice cream brand, Wall’s.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Variable Definitions\n",
    "- **Life Ladder**: Happiness score or subjective well-being (variable name ladder ), The survey measure of SWB is from the Feb 26, 2021 release of the Gallup World Poll (GWP) covering years from 2005 to 2020. Unless stated otherwise, it is the national average response to the question of life evaluations. The English wording of the question is “Please imagine a ladder, with steps numbered from 0 at the bottom to 10 at the top. The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you. On which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you stand at this time?” This measure is also referred to as Cantril life ladder, or just life ladderin our analysis.\n",
    "- **Log GDP per capita**: The statistics of GDP per capita (variable name gdp) in purchasing power parity (PPP) at constant 2017 international dollar prices are from the October 14, 2020 update of the World Development Indicators (WDI). The GDP figures for Taiwan, Syria, Palestine, Venezuela, Djibouti and Ymen are from the Penn World Table 9.1.\n",
    "- **Healthy life expectancy at birth**: Healthy life expectancies at birth are based on the data extracted from the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Global Health Observatory data repository (Last updated: 2020-09-28). The data at the source are available for the years 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2016. To match this report’s sample period (2005-2020), interpolation and extrapolation are used.\n",
    "- **Social support**: (or having someone to count on in times of trouble) is the national average of the binary responses (either 0 or 1) to the GWP question “If you were in trouble, do you have relatives or friends you can count on to help you whenever you need them, or not?”\n",
    "- **Freedom to make life choices**: Freedom to make life choices is the national average of responses to the GWP question “Are you satisfied or dissatisfied with your freedom to choose what you do with your life?”\n",
    "- **Generosity**: Generosity is the residual of regressing national average of response to the GWP question “Have you donated money to a charity in the past month?” on GDP per capita.\n",
    "- **Perceptions of corruption**: The measure is the national average of the survey responses to two questions in the GWP: “Is corruption widespread throughout the government or not” and “Is corruption widespread within businesses or not?” The overall perception is just the average of the two 0-or-1 responses. In case the perception of government corruption is missing, we use the perception of business corruption as the overall perception. The corruption perception at the national level is just the average response of the overall perception at the individual level.\n",
    "- **Positive affect**: Positive affect is defined as the average of three positive affect measures in GWP: happiness, laugh and enjoyment in the Gallup World Poll waves 3-7. These measures are the responses to the following three questions, respectively: “Did you experience the following feelings during A LOT OF THE DAY yesterday? How about Happiness?”, “Did you smile or laugh a lot yesterday?”, and “Did you experience the following feelings during A LOT OF THE DAY yesterday? How about Enjoyment?” Waves 3-7 cover years 2008 to 2012 and a small number of countries in 2013. For waves 1-2 and those from wave 8 on, positive affect is defined as the average of laugh and enjoyment only, due to the limited availability of happiness.\n",
    "- **Negative affect**: Negative affect is defined as the average of three negative affect measures in GWP. They are worry, sadness and anger, respectively the responses to “Did you experience the following feelings during A LOT OF THE DAY yesterday? How about Worry?”, “Did you experience the following feelings during A LOT OF THE DAY yesterday? How about Sadness?”, and “Did you experience the following feelings during A LOT OF THE DAY yesterday? How about Anger?”"
