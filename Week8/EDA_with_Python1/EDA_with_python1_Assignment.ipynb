    "The Garment Industry is one of the key examples of the industrial globalization of this modern era. It is a highly labour-intensive industry with lots of manual processes. Satisfying the huge global demand for garment products is mostly dependent on the production and delivery performance of the employees in the garment manufacturing companies. So, it is highly desirable among the decision makers in the garments industry to track, analyse and predict the productivity performance of the working teams in their factories. This dataset can be used for regression purpose by predicting the productivity range (0-1) or for classification purpose by transforming the productivity range (0-1) into different classes.\n",

    "\n",
    "This data is for the purpose of bias correction of next-day maximum and minimum air temperatures forecast of the LDAPS model operated by the Korea Meteorological Administration over Seoul, South Korea. This data consists of summer data from 2013 to 2017. The input data is largely composed of the LDAPS model's next-day forecast data, in-situ maximum and minimum temperatures of present-day, and geographic auxiliary variables. There are two outputs (i.e. next-day maximum and minimum air temperatures) in this data. Hindcast validation was conducted for the period from 2015 to 2017.\n",
